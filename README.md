# Pytorch from scratch with MNIST #
This repository contains the scratch notebooks where MNIST dataset is used to learn PyTorch. Here, it has started from the very beginning with manual `numpy` array and `torch.autograd` and `torch.tensor` and it gradually moves to bit more complicated but easy to handle code convension. 


This tutorial assumes you already have **PyTorch** installed, and are familiar with the basics of tensor operations. (If you’re familiar with Numpy array operations, you’ll find the PyTorch tensor operations used here nearly identical).

This repository is the step by step notebook of whats in the tutorial of https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html

Thanks to Jeremy Howard of https://www.fast.ai/ for such a nice step  by step tutorial.
